In a place unknown there was a restaurant... that restaurant was everything and nothing at the same time, some people referred to it as the restaurant of life.
In that restaurant there was a table that somehow changed every time you entered the restaurant.
Sometimes there were just a few people sitting there sometimes there was way more.
Odd, even the number was constantly changing. The table only had philosophers, once they sat down they were stuck for the rest of their life.
Viewers could define how many of them should sit, how long they were allowed to stay without eating before died, how long they had to eat for, how long they should sleep for and some were allowed to define how many times they were allowed to eat before the table disappeared.
Once the philosophers sat down on the table, a glitching presence would appear behind each of them.
We don't know anything about this presence other than the fact that it was there and would pull out a gun if any of the participants broke any rule.
